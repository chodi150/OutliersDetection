# OutliersDetection

#Problem Description
A dataset OD_dataset.csv with the aggregated transactional data for merchants (AKA entities) belonging to the "Fast Food Restaurants" category is given.
The aggregation is done by grouping transactional data by the [entity_id] column. You can make an assumption that there are approx. 1% of outliers. This
dataset contains 33 columns.


1) Perform exploratory analysis of the dataset.
Find outliers / anomalies using any unsupervised learning algorithm(s) / ensembles (at least two methods). One of the method should make use
of deep learning.

Used techniques:
- PAM clustering
- Autoencoder 



2) Visualize the data and detected outliers using at least two different dimensionality reduction techniques.

Used techniques:
- PCA
- t-SNE

3) Visualizations of results done in Plotly
